Puppet-ScaleIO
======================
The primary purpose of this project is create automation necessary for an Operations team to install and configure ScaleIO nodes using Puppet.  As an additional benefit, we provided as a valuable example of Vagrantfiles which allow rapid deployment with pre-defined Puppet environments to configure ScaleIO deployments on a laptop or through other Vagrant providers.  The project allows for a flexible ScaleIO environment serving for production, demos, or development.
